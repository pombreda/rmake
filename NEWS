Changes in @NEW@:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * rMake now encodes all text logs when transmitting them over xmlrpc so that any unicode
      or other characters do not get interpreted. (RMK-137)

Changes in 0.9:

  o Client Changes:
    * Add an explicit error message for redirect and group recipes, which 
      rMake cannot cook. (RMK-9)
    * rMake now tells you when a job is queued. (RMK-88)
    * rMake now has has callbacks to tell you how a commit is proceeding.  It
      also now asks you for a message for a recipe build on commit, not when 
      you start to build the recipe (depends on conary 1.0.30).
    * added a strictMode config option that does not copy in configuration
      files or conary from your local system, but instead uses the conary
      and configuration in the chroot (RMK-167).
    * Added resolveTrovesOnly config option, it does not use your 
      installLabelPath to resolve dependencies but instead limits itself to 
      only the resolveTroves list (RMK-166).
    * You can now build groups and redirect recipes with rMake, as long as
      the group or redirect recipe is the only this requested to be built
      in the job (RMK-125).
    * As a part of the changes needed for building groups, recursively building
      the contents of a group has been renamed "buildgroup".
    * You can now commit partial builds (if the commit fails, rMake will
      move the status back to failed).
    * rMake now will sign troves with the available signature keys on commit
      (RMK-149).
    * rMake client config is now renamed to rmakerc, and reads
      /etc/rmakerc, ~/.rmakerc, and ./rmakerc on startup.
    * rMake now supports the CONARY file format used in conary 
      1.0.31 and forward. (RMK-176)
    * rMake's pygtk dependencies are split out into a :gtk component. (RMK-177)

  o Server Changes:
    * Added 'rmake-server reset' command, to delete the entire contents
      of the rmake internal repository as well as the job list.
    * Change repository to be based off of hostname.
    * Added the ability to use an external repository for as the internal
      rMake repository by specifying the serverName, serverUrl and user 
      parameters (RMK-165).
    * Added a useTmpfs configuration option.  If used, the build will
      be done on a tmpfs filesystem within the chroot. (RMK-163)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * Don't include the trove's label in the search path automatically -
      let the user do that explicitly.
    * Don't die if /etc/localtime doesn't exist (RMK-126)
    * Fix password prompter to work with contexts (RMK-89)
    * Fix dep resolution handling of cases where more than one
      trove of different flavors in a group could resolve buildreq (RMK-152).
    * Resolve troves no longer show up in the resolve trove list twice.
    * 'rmake build' without any troves returns a usage message (RMK-155).
    * In some cases rMake must choose between x86 and x86_64 troves that
      both solve intraTrove dependencies but conflict.  In this case,
      conary should pick one using normal dep resolution rules.
    * If the rMake internal repository cannot start or if it dies, the
      rMake server will shut down (RMK-185).
    * rMake now handles cooks that die due a signal (a segfault, e.g.)
      gracefully (RMK-181).
    * rMake will now fail cooks when it runs into an internal error, in the
      cook checking code.  The cook will be stopped at that point (RMK-179).
    * When a needed file cannot be copied into the chroot, rMake will now
      fail with a user-friendly error (RMK-156).

Changes in 0.5 (BETA):
  We are now calling this the BETA of rMake 1.

  o Client Changes:
    * rMake now supports a password helper for its xml interface, that
      will pop up a gui window to ask you for username/passord (RMK-89)
    * rMake now supports a "reset" option (RMK-5).
    * allow resolveTroves entries to be ordered (RMK-59).
    * tell users to look at the buildlog when their chroot server didn't
      start. (RMK-116)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed a bug in commit behavior where builds with troves on different 
      branches would not commit all troves from that build (RMK-106).
    * You can now cook recipes with flavors
    * Fixed a bug where trying to commit a failed job would result in the
      job's state being set to BUILT (RMK-113)
    * rmake start should not return STARTED unless the start is actually
      successful (RMK-111)
    * rmake now setuids before killing processes both ensure no incorrect
      processes are killed and also to make sure logfile is owned by the right
      user. (RMK-102)
    * Stopping a job will set all troves in "INIT" state to failed (RMK-83)
    * Fixed a bug that kept building from groups from working. (RMK-118)
    * Don't traceback with IOError on broken pipe (RMK-120)

Changes in 0.4:
  o Client Changes:
    * The rMake server now tracks a "Committing" and "Committed" state.
      It will send out state updated messages to subscribers when committing
      troves (RMK-54).
    * Added support for a stop command (RMK-76).
    * Subscribers are now passed an apiVersion as the first parameter, allowing
      their behavior to change based on the version of rmake they are
      dealing with (RMK-77)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed bug that caused rmake to fail to build troves with names that were 
      2 characters long (RMK-86)
    * Environment variables in configurations are now expanded before they
      are sent over to the server, since the environment there isn't the
      same (Requires conary 1.0.21 or newer) (RMK-80)
    * Handle unicode in logs from builds by converting to escaped utf-8 
      (RMK-91)
    * Do a better job of updating internal shadow to source changes
      when performing a cook of a local file.  Adds and removes are now
      handled correctly. (RMK-95)
    * rmake commands now print an error message when passed an invalid 
      jobId or UUID (RMK-101)
    * rMake's home directory in the build chroot is now set to something
      that rmake can write to.

Changes in 0.3:
  o Client Changes:
    * rMake can now perform builds using local Conary recipes and
      sources.  If the recipe is associated with a source component,
      you can commit the source component and binary together.  This
      association is determined through the CONARY file, which is
      normally created by running "cvc checkout".  The CONARY file and
      the conary recipe file must be in the same directory.  This
      feature requires Conary 1.0.19. (RMK-40)
    * rMake supports a specifying a uuid with a build, needed for integrating 
      rMake with rBuilder Online (RMK-73)
    * Slightly delay output of emit events in order to collate them

  o Bug Fixes:
    * rMake now uses the "buildLabel" and "buildFlavor" configuration
      variables to find troves to build, and "installLabelPath" and
      "flavor" variables to find solutions to build
      dependencies. (RMK-53)
    * The "/sbin/service rmake status" status message has been
      fixed. Thanks to David Coulthart for the bug report and fix. (RMK-69)
    * The default use flag and policy directories are now copied into
      the build chroot so that locally defined use flags and policies
      are available to build against. (RMK-68)
    * Build requirement dependency resolution is now calculated by the
      rMake client instead of the rMake server. (RMK-46, RMK-60)
    * Newly created checkouts (created with the cvc newpkg command) can now be
      cooked (RMK-81)
    * chroothelper would access nonexistant variable and segfault on cleanup,
      now all chroothelper exit statuses are checked (RMK-66)

Changes in 0.2:
  o Client Changes:
    * Query output fixup: only display the full list of troves for a job 
      when no trove is specified.
    * Add rmake q <jobId> --poll for convenience

  o Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed traceback if reading conary config results in a parse error
    * Improved traceback output message
    * rMake no longer tries to sign troves at build time, since passwords 
      cannot be read at that time.
    * rmake changeset and rmake commit were broken
    * a change in conary caused rmake builds to fail with conary 1.0.18.

Changes in 0.1:
    * Initial test release
