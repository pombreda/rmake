The configured Conary proxy cache will now always be used by the rMake server
and worker nodes. Previously, if a client had a conaryProxy or proxyMap setting
when starting the build then that would take precedence. The client still has
precedence for its own operations i.e. the initial load of the recipe and
committing of jobs.
